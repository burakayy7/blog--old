In this post I will be introducing the math behind Gradient Descent and how it works!

I was first introduced to Gradient Descent when I had to implement autoregressive models from scratch. To learn this, I first tried to implement a Linear Regression. 

Linear Regressions are brought up in the context of tring to find a line that best fits the trend of a data set.
