Welcome everyone!! In this post, I would like to introduce you guys to my long held dream: to build an autonomously flying high-altitude, long range, airplane! And to make things more
interesting, it has to be made from off-the-shelf components, with fully DIY code!! Enjoy!!


So, every since elementary school, I have always wanted to build and fly my own RC plane; and I have the notebook entries and failed foam planes to prove it!! However, I always was confronted with the same three challenges: cost, complexity, and technical knowledge. Buying all the components necessayr to build a plane from scratch is obviously going to cost a lot. Then, there's the complex system or framework you have to make in how all the electronics and mechanics will work together in a compact and lightweight manner. And finally, to do all of this, you require knowledge in how each component works, like Arduinos, servos, radios, etc. And this was quite a lot until I got into this hobby in late 7th grade. That's when I finally decided to go all in on this!

After many failed attempts, there I was a couple months back, in winter break. Yet again, building another plane chasis from foam boards. Until I came accross this video by [Joe Barnard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aODpSGoqLY). BOOM! It hit me. Why am I tyring to do everything from scratch??

So, I got myself one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/XFLY-MODEL-Wingspan-Airplane-Beginner-Transmitter/dp/B0BXD5R27D/ref=sr_1_15?crid=WZMKIZSUOAT4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9OWWmkdCHsz5c-DNkaQEVo5dcEsyN6YgMk2Jh6pfwYn-7OCxUGz47DwV7FBpYgiSUy5ZZizDdL_rXp-tFn2dxgsmeqqXCv9zOYPHiXomlUAzDSGgnSF6U17HNJWNdMgpP4XzlZ-0RcZLCktkPGsGLAGi8avZwyn6T1VsiaOEdMRackGgAovn_xBZwFRZ9BZe-4-WMrchm7K31_wqc1zBKMxKihaUryryl2EgthBlgSu4BO3LXGnrp9W6ZXOqph2QF4GnLsTna1z0FyISWm3T9qumG_ynAnxrc-Sf04sLAWc.jEpOzOXoMyrPtl7LCrAT3I9b4OoVqs5ST567iDZtuDo&dib_tag=se&keywords=volantex+rc+glider&qid=1721079633&sprefix=volantex+rc+glider%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-15) but like a 2-meter one.
