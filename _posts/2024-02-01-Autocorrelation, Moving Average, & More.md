A simple introduction to Autocorrelation, Moving Average, STL Decomposition, Seasonal Trends, and much more!

Today, I would like to teach you about Forecasting Principles, which include but aren't limited to, Autocorrelation, moving average filters, additive and multiplicative decomposition, STL decomposition, etc.

This became relevant when I started my research on forecasting epidemics like the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate question at hand would be something along the lines of, how many people will be hospitilized after t days and in which specific location. These statistics can be very useful when making political, societal, or economic based decisions.
