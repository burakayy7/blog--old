For a long time, I have been gathering resources to help me with my goals and projects. Specifically, I have been slowly growing my collection of technical books, from 6th grade to the present. And I would like to share them with you here. 


All of these are going to be in sequential order, so the first one is my first ever technical book and so on. I will also be providing a rating from 1 - 5, for how much I recommend a book to someone.

I got this book at the end of 6th grade, and I think that it is a wonderful book for beginners to get started with math and for those who want to get ahead in school. However, if you really want to learn the theory behind math, you will have to do some thinking and deriving on your own. But also, everyone needs to start somewhere, and I think this is an amazing book. It also provides plenty of problems and solutions, so a really nice resource for self-learners.

Right after I finished the Algebra book, I went on to this. And let me tell you, it is nothing like any other math book. This book will challenge you to really **think!** You cannot get away by memorizing a bunch of equations and rules, you have to actually **learn** math. It starts off with simple topics like algebra and geometry, then briefly touches on combinatorics and proofs. However, every chapter in this book will challenge you in some way, non of it is "easy". Getting through this book will take a lot of patience, thus I **don't reccomend this** if this will be your first math book or you're just starting off with learning math. In fact, the authors intended these books to be used in a classroom type setting, or at least in an enviornment in whcih you will have support. While this is an amazing self-teaching book, it will require you to give your all, so be prepared!

This book is about, like the title suggests, teaching the theory and algorithms behind data science; from regression and decision trees to machine learning and NLP. But be aware that this book is very dense. It really asks a lot of time and I don't think you should read it in a sequential order. But putting that aside, this book is just amazing. You will be able to follow along with the author as he teaches you the basics then the nuts and bolts of how complicated algorithms work! By the end, I guarentee that you will learn a lot and have a lot of confidence in your programming abilities!
