For a long time, I have been gathering resources to help me with my goals and projects. Specifically, I have been slowly growing my collection of technical books, from 6th grade to the present. And I would like to share them with you here. 


All of these are going to be in sequential order, so the first one is my first ever technical book and so on. I will also be providing a rating from 1 - 5, for how much I recommend a book to someone.

I got this book at the end of 6th grade, and I think that it is a wonderful book for beginners to get started with math and for those who want to get ahead in school. However, if you really want to learn the theory behind math, you will have to do some thinking and deriving on your own. But also, everyone needs to start somewhere, and I think this is an amazing book. It also provides plenty of problems and solutions, so a really nice resource for self-learners.

Right after I finished the Algebra book, I went on to this. And let me tell you, it is nothing like any other math book. This book will challenge you to really **think!** You cannot get away by memorizing a bunch of equations and rules, you have to actually **learn** math. It starts off with simple topics like algebra and geometry, then briefly touches on combinatorics and proofs. However, every chapter in this book will challenge you in some way, non of it is "easy". Getting through this book will take a lot of patience, thus I **don't reccomend this** if this will be your first math book or you're just starting off with learning math. In fact, the authors intended these books to be used in a classroom type setting, or at least in an enviornment in whcih you will have support. While this is an amazing self-teaching book, it will require you to give your all, so be prepared!

This book is considered a classic in the field of control theory, and I had initially gotten this in 9th grade to learn the theory behind some of my projects. However, I was way ahead of myself, as this book is like a graduate level text. It is really heavy in Linear Algebra and Calculus (which I didn't know at the time). In fact, I think this is probably the most dense book I ever had. But now with all of the knowlegde I have accumulated over the years, I highly recommend this book for people who want to dive deep, very deep, into this subject.

This book is about, like the title suggests, teaching the theory and algorithms behind data science; from regression and decision trees to machine learning and NLP. But be aware that this book is very dense. It really asks a lot of time and I don't think you should read it in a sequential order. But putting that aside, this book is just amazing. You will be able to follow along with the author as he teaches you the basics then the nuts and bolts of how complicated algorithms work! By the end, I guarentee that you will learn a lot and have a lot of confidence in your programming abilities!

If you are interested in ML at the ultra-edge, then this is your book! It's amazing; you will learn and actually apply 5 ML projects on arduino based microcontrollers! In my opinion, this is one of my favorite topics in emebedded systems, in fact, this book motivated me to do my science fair project! I highly recommend this to anyone in electroncis or embedded systems!

This is the second Part of the AoPS Contest Books, and is even more difficult than Volume 1. I have met many, many people who got cocky and skipped Volume 1 and went directly to Volume 2, and ended up quitting entirely (sometimes even the subject of math) due to how much this book will push you. If in Volume 1 you were required to just follow along and solve the problems, here you are expected to derive equations yourself. However, if you really want to learn, I highly suggest this. Even though this was intended to be used by students with instructors, it is still one of my favorite resources for learning the "puzzle" aspect of math!

I bought this book after the Data Science book, in hopes of getting a more in depth understanding to DL, however, I didn't quite like how this book taught it. While some really like this book, especially with how it gives you multiple different ways to think about concepts (which is actually the first time I have ever seen this in a bok), I felt like it failed in delivering the fundamentals aspect of DL.

As you have probably guessed, this book isn't really a highly technical book. It's more like an autobiography which also happens to touch on math concepts. But I included them here because it still provides a way for someone to get interested in math. I highly recommend this if you want to see an alternative perspective to math.

This book is just a **classic!** It was written a long time ago by a famous mathematician, George Pólya, and it will show you how to **think** about solving problems. It isn't necessarily a textbook, more of like a novel; but it does provide you with problems and solutions. I just love this, it makes you actually want to think!

I haven't actually finished this book, but from what I have read, I think it gives a pretty good perspective on how to think about math topics. But I don't suggest to use this for studying. It's more of a free-time type of book; but nonetheless, I still think it's a valuable resource. 


<div align="center">
    <h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3LwglcP" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Everaise Academy: Math Competitions 1</a></h2>

If you want to quickly prepare for Math competitions (AMC 10/12, AIME, etc) I **highly** suggest this book. It will quickly give you the gist of every topic, without relying on too much memorization. But if you are looking to learn theory, I don't think this is the best book. It still challenges you to think and solve hard problems on your own, though. I kind of wish I had started with this book because then maybe I would of been more motivated to compete in the AMCs.

Again, this book is a must for learning algorithms! I just started this book, and I already felt like this was a masterpiece after the first few pages. **Every Computer Science** student should read this at some point!! Perfect!
