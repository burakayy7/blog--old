For a long time, I have been gathering resources to help me with my goals and projects. Specifically, I have been slowly growing my collection of technical books, from 6th grade to the present. And I would like to share them with you here. 


All of these are going to be in sequential order, so the first one is my first ever technical book and so on. I will also be providing a rating from 1 - 5, for how much I recommend a book to someone.
